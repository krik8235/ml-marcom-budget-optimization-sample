# Optimize marketing spend using machine learning algorithms

## Introduction
This project aims to use machine learning to help e-commerce companies optimize their marketing budget allocation to maximize revenue and ROI.

## Approach
Build a model that predicts whether a user is likely to engage with an ad and allocates budget accordingly.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  * Understand the features and their relationships with target variables

* Data Preparation:
  * Encode the variables using label encoding
  * Split the dataset into training and testing sets

* Prediction:
  * Random forest
  * Light gradient boosting
  * Extreme gradient boosting
